# AIditor

**An AI-native editor built for structured, memory-aware, token-efficient collaboration.**

AIditor is an open-source experiment in rethinking text editors for the age of AI.

Instead of treating documents as raw strings, AIditor models them as structured semantic blocks — allowing AI to operate intelligently, efficiently, and deterministically.

This is not an editor with AI features.
This is an editor designed for AI as a first-class participant.

## 🚩 The Problem

Most AI-assisted editors today:

* Send entire files as prompts
* Rewrite large sections unnecessarily
* Waste tokens
* Lose context between sessions
* Produce unpredictable edits

Traditional editors were not designed for AI-native workflows.

AIditor is.
